Little White Lily
    Sat by a stone,
    Drooping and waiting
    Till the sun shone.
    Little White Lily
    Sunshine has fed;
    Little White Lily
    Is lifting her head.

    Little White Lily
    Said: "It is good
    Little White Lily's
    Clothing and food."
    Little White Lily
    Dressed like a bride!
    Shining with whiteness,
    And crown√®d beside!

    Little White Lily
    Drooping with pain,
    Waiting and waiting
    For the wet rain.
    Little White Lily
    Holdeth her cup;
    Rain is fast falling
    And filling it up.

    Little White Lily
    Said: "Good again,
    When I am thirsty
    To have the nice rain.
    Now I am stronger,
    Now I am cool;
    Heat cannot burn me,
    My veins are so full."

    Little White Lily
    Smells very sweet;
    On her head sunshine,
    Rain at her feet.
    Thanks to the sunshine,
    Thanks to the rain,
    Little White Lily
    Is happy again.
